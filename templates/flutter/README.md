Pocket Pandit — Flutter skeleton

This is a small starter showing how to load puja JSON and display a list.

To run:

1. Install Flutter SDK (see flutter.dev).
2. From this folder run `flutter create .` (or open in IDE) and replace `lib/main.dart` with the provided file.
3. Add `assets/data/example_pujas.json` to `pubspec.yaml` under assets and run `flutter run`.

Notes: This is a skeleton; use it as a starting point to integrate `data/example_pujas.json`.
